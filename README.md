# Churches List

This is a simple form I bult after learning Javascript DOM manipulatio to test the new Javascript I just learned.

The form Allows you to add Church, Delete and Filter the churches.

Some of the DOM features use are;
--
* Add Event Listner
* Create Element and Create Text Node
* Boostrap 4

It was challenging but I finally bult it. The UI was designed with Bootstrap 4.
